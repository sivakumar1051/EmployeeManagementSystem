#project description
This project is an Employee Management System implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework. 
It allows users to manage employee records, including adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employee details. 
The application uses JSP files for rendering the user interface and is configured to run on a Tomcat embedded server.
 
 # guidelines to run the project
 To run the project, ensure that you have Java 17 or higher and Maven installed on your machine. 
 Import the project into your IDE as a Maven project.
Run the EmployeeManagementSystemLab10Application class to start the application.
Once the application is running, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8081/employees for lab10 and http://localhost:8080/employees  for lab 11 to access the home page,
where you can view the list of employees. 
Use the "Add Employee" option to add new employee records, "Edit" to update existing records, 
and "Delete" to remove employees. Each action redirects you back to the home page, reflecting the updated employee list.
Ensure all dependencies are included in the pom.xml, and JSP files are placed in the src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views directory for proper rendering.
